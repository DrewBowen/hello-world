# hello-world

Hello, this is my first brush with Git. I have heard that it is extremely important for programmers. 
I am a computer science student at Arkansas State University in Jonesboro. I have not worked in the
Industry as a Software Engineer yet, but I will be graduating from Astate rather soon. So I am 
hopeful that I will be able to get myself a nice job and become the best person I can be.
